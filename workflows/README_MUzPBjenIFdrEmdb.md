# GitHub Workflow Backup with README Generation

## General Description

This workflow automates the backup of n8n workflows to a GitHub repository and generates a README.md file describing the workflow's functionality.  It checks for changes in the workflow, and updates the backup and/or README accordingly.

## Step-by-step operation

1.  **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**:  This node triggers the workflow manually (for testing purposes).  It is activated when the "Test Workflow" button in the n8n UI is clicked.
2.  **Execute Workflow Trigger**:  This node is the entry point when the workflow is triggered. It passes data to the rest of the workflow.
3.  **tag?**: This switch node checks for the presence of tags in the incoming data.
4.  **/:** This set node configures the tag.
5.  **Globals**: This node retrieves global variables.
6.  **Loop Over Items**: This node splits the workflow into batches
7.  **Execute Workflow**: This node executes the sub workflow which handles the data.
8.  **Schedule Trigger**: This is the workflow's trigger that defines the execution schedule.
9.  **n8n**:  This node calls a sub workflow.
10. **Get file data**: Retrieves the content of the existing workflow backup file from GitHub.
11. **Globals**: Sets the global variables used in the workflow, including:
    *   `repo.owner`: Your GitHub username.
    *   `repo.name`: The name of your GitHub repository.
    *   `repo.path`: The path within your repository where you want to store the workflow backups.
12. **Get File**: Fetches the latest version of the workflow file (JSON) from GitHub.
13. **If file too large**: Checks whether the file size exceeds a certain limit, and if true, skips the "Get File" node.
14. **Merge Items**: Merges the retrieved file data with the current workflow data.
15. **isDiffOrNew**:  This Code node compares the current workflow with the backed-up workflow (if any). It determines if the workflow is "same", "different", or "new". It also prepares data to be stored in the github repo.
16. **Check Status**: This switch node directs the workflow based on the comparison result from the "isDiffOrNew" node.
17. **Same file - Do nothing**: If the workflow is identical to the backup, the workflow stops (no action).
18. **File is different**: If the workflow has changed, this path is taken.
19. **File is new**:  If the workflow is new (no backup exists), this path is taken.
20. **Edit existing file**: If the workflow is different, this node updates the backup file on GitHub.
21. **Create new file**: If the workflow is new, this node creates a new backup file on GitHub.
22. **Basic LLM Chain**: This node is the entry point for the LLM chain to generate the README. It is disabled.
23. **Google Gemini Chat Model**: This node is a Google Gemini model call and is disabled.
24. **Edit existing readme**: This node is meant to edit the existing readme, but is disabled.
25. **Create new readme**:  This node is designed to create the README file (but is disabled).

## Dependencies or services used

*   **n8n**: This workflow runs on the n8n platform.
*   **GitHub**: The workflow interacts with the GitHub API for:
    *   Fetching existing workflow backup files.
    *   Creating new workflow backup files.
    *   Updating existing workflow backup files.
    *   Generating README.md files.
*   **Google Gemini (PaLM)**:  Used for generating the README file. It is disabled.
*   **Langchain**: Used for generating the README file.

## Scheduled execution

The workflow can be triggered:

*   **Manually**: By clicking the "Test workflow" button in the n8n UI.
*   **Automatically**: Based on the schedule defined in the "Schedule Trigger" node.

## Tips or remarks

*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   You need an active n8n instance.
    *   You need a GitHub account and a repository where you want to store the backups.
    *   You need to configure your GitHub credentials in n8n (in the GitHub node).
    *   You need to configure your Google Gemini API key in n8n (in the Gemini node).
*   **Configuration**:
    *   In the "Globals" node, you *must* configure:
        *   `repo.owner`: Your GitHub username.
        *   `repo.name`: The name of your GitHub repository.
        *   `repo.path`: The path within your repository where you want to store the workflow backups (e.g., `workflows/`).  The trailing slash is important.
    *   This workflow uses a sub-workflow; this reduces memory usage.
*   **LLM Usage:** The Google Gemini nodes and the LLM chain nodes are disabled, so the workflow does not generate README files.  To enable this, you would need to:
    *   Enable the LLM chain node, and the relevant Gemini Chat Model.
    *   Configure the LLM Chain with appropriate prompts.
