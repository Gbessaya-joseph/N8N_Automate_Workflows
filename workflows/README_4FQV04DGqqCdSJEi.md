# Workflow: My workflow 4 - Backup n8n Workflows to GitHub

## General description

This workflow backs up n8n workflows to a GitHub repository. It retrieves workflow data, compares it with the existing backup, and creates or updates a file in the repository based on changes. It also attempts to use a LLM to enhance the documentation with an agent.

## Step-by-step operation

1.  **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**: This is the initial trigger when the workflow is tested manually.
2.  **Execute Workflow Trigger**:  This node acts as the primary trigger for the main workflow logic. This is likely used to get the workflow that is triggering this instance.
3.  **tag?**: Checks if the workflow is part of a tag. If it is it will proceed. If not, it will use the `none` output.
4.  **Globals**: Sets global variables such as GitHub repository owner, name, and path. These values determine where the workflow backups are stored.
5.  **/:** Sets a tag name for the file path.
6.  **Loop Over Items**: Splits the workflows into batches, allowing to process all the available workflows one by one.
7.  **Execute Workflow**: Calls the subworkflow (presumably this one).
8.  **Get file data**: Retrieves the existing workflow data from the specified GitHub repository using the github node.
9.  **If file too large**: Checks if the retrieved file data has "content" data or if there is an error.
    *   If the file has no content, it triggers the merge item to initiate a create action in the github repo.
    *   If the file is too large, then it triggers the merge item to initiate a create action in the github repo.
10. **Merge Items**: Merges data from two sources, likely the current workflow data and the previous GitHub data.
11. **isDiffOrNew**: Compares the current workflow data with the data retrieved from GitHub to determine if the workflow is new, different, or the same.
12. **Check Status**:  A switch node that routes the workflow based on the comparison result from `isDiffOrNew`:
    *   **Same file - Do nothing**:  If the files are identical, the workflow does nothing.
    *   **File is different**: If the workflow files are different, the workflow proceeds to update the file in the GitHub repository.
    *   **File is new**:  If the workflow is new, the workflow proceeds to create the file in the GitHub repository.
13. **Edit existing file**: Updates the existing workflow file on GitHub with the new workflow data.
14. **Basic LLM Chain**: This is a deactivated node.
15. **Google Gemini Chat Model**: This is a deactivated node.
16. **Create new file**:  Creates a new workflow file in the GitHub repository.
17. **Return**: Terminates the workflow execution, when a file is edited or if no changes were found.
18. **Google Gemini Chat Model1**: This is a deactivated node.
19. **create new readme**: It creates a readme.md file for the new workflow in the github repo.
20. **enchance the youtube transcript**: The agent is used to enhance the readme.md file for documentation purposes.
21. **Google Gemini Chat Model2**: This is a deactivated node.

## Dependencies or services used

*   **n8n**: The core automation platform.
*   **GitHub**: Used to store and retrieve workflow backups.
*   **Google Gemini**: Potentially for generating or enhancing documentation using LLMs (nodes are disabled).

## Scheduled execution

*   The workflow can be triggered manually via the "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" trigger.
*   The workflow can be triggered automatically through a schedule.

## Tips or remarks

*   **Prerequisites**:
    *   A GitHub account and repository are required.
    *   n8n needs to be properly configured with GitHub credentials.
*   **Important Considerations**:
    *   The "Globals" node requires configuration with your GitHub repository details (owner, name, and path).
    *   The workflow utilizes subworkflows and loops.
    *   LLM nodes for documentation generation are currently disabled.
