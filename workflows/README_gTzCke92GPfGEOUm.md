# Email Verification Workflow

## General Description

This workflow handles the process of sending an email verification code to a user upon receiving a request via a webhook. It receives user data (email and verification code), sends a verification email using Gmail, and responds to the webhook with a success message.

## Step-by-step operation

1.  **Webhook (Trigger):**
    *   **Role:** This node acts as the trigger for the workflow. It listens for an incoming POST request on a specific endpoint. The endpoint URL is generated by n8n and can be used to trigger the workflow.
    *   **Method:** POST.
    *   **Path:** `e3f360ca-61fe-4be4-b8bf-0cc5896e8fe2`
    *   **Action:** This node waits for an incoming POST request containing user data such as an email and a verification code in the request body.

2.  **Gmail (Send Email):**
    *   **Role:** Sends an email to the user with the verification code.
    *   **Action:** Retrieves the email address from the webhook request body and sends an email to that address. The email subject is "Verify your Email Adress". The email body includes a personalized message and the verification code extracted from the webhook payload.
    *   **Email Address:**  `{{ $json.body.email }}` (dynamically populated from the webhook request body).
    *   **Email Body Content:**  Includes a greeting, information about the email verification process, and a verification code.

3.  **Respond to Webhook:**
    *   **Role:** This node sends a response back to the system that triggered the webhook.
    *   **Action:**  Sends a JSON response indicating the success of the email sending process.
    *   **Response Body:** Includes a success status, a success message, and the email address to which the verification email was sent.

## Dependencies or services used

*   **n8n:** The automation platform used to build and run the workflow.
*   **Gmail:** Used for sending the email verification code. Requires valid Gmail account credentials configured in n8n.
*   **Webhook:** The workflow is triggered by a POST request received on a specific webhook URL.

## Scheduled execution

The workflow is triggered automatically via the Webhook node.  It is triggered in response to a POST request.

## Tips or remarks

*   Ensure that the correct Gmail account is configured and connected to the Gmail node in n8n.
*   The webhook URL must be securely protected.
*   The workflow assumes that the incoming webhook request body includes the `email` and `verificationCode` in a JSON format.
