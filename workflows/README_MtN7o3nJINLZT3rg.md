# n8n Workflow: Automate Tasks with AI and Email

## General Description

This workflow automates a set of tasks, combining scheduled email sending with AI-powered responses and actions, triggered both by a schedule and by receiving a chat message. It uses AI models to process information, interacts with Google Calendar, and sends emails based on the processed data.

## Step-by-step Operation

1.  **Schedule Trigger**: (Disabled) This node, when active, would trigger the workflow based on a set schedule. It uses a time interval (e.g., minutes) to determine when to run.
2.  **Gmail1**: (Disabled) This node sends an email. The email is configured with a recipient, subject, and message. It is not directly connected to the schedule trigger, nor is it directly influenced by the other parts of the workflow.
3.  **When chat message received**: This is a webhook trigger. It starts the workflow when a chat message is received.
4.  **AI Agent**: This node uses an AI agent, taking inputs and utilizing tools and language models.
5.  **Google Gemini Chat Model**: This node is an AI language model. It provides the ability to leverage Google Gemini AI models, which are used by the AI agent.
6.  **Google Calendar**: This node interacts with Google Calendar, likely to create, read, or update calendar events, receiving AI tools.
7.  **Code**: This node executes custom JavaScript code. It defines variables for email configuration, including recipient, subject, and the body, possibly derived from a summary of daily activities.
8.  **Gmail**: This node sends an email, with the details populated dynamically from the code node's output. It uses variables set in the Code node (recipient, subject and content) to send the email.
9.  **AI Agent1**: This node is used as part of a second, separate workflow path, triggered when a chat message is received.
10. **OpenRouter Chat Model**: This node provides access to a different AI language model via OpenRouter, to interact with AI Agent1.

## Dependencies or services used

*   n8n (Workflow automation platform)
*   Gmail (for sending emails)
*   Google Gemini AI (Language Model)
*   Google Calendar (for calendar operations)
*   OpenRouter (for AI language model)

## Scheduled execution

*   The workflow can be triggered manually.
*   The workflow has a schedule trigger but is currently disabled.
*   The workflow can be triggered by a chat message via a webhook.

## Tips or remarks

*   The workflow is currently inactive (some nodes are disabled), and requires activation of the Schedule Trigger and Gmail1 nodes.
*   The workflow utilizes AI models, making it essential to configure and connect to appropriate API credentials.
*   The Code node allows for customization of the email content. You may need to adjust the code according to your specific needs.
*   Ensure that your Gmail and Google Calendar accounts are properly authorized within the n8n platform to allow the workflow to access and modify the information.
